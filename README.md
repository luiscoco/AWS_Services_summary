**Fully managed batch processing**

AWS Batch is a managed batch processing service that enables developers, scientists, and engineers to easily and efficiently run hundreds of thousands of batch computing jobs on AWS

AWS Batch removes the undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing the required infrastructure

It dynamically provisions the optimal quantity and type of compute resources (e.g., CPU or memory optimized compute resources) based on the volume and specific resource requirements of the batch jobs submitted

With AWS Batch, there is no need to install and manage batch computing software or server clusters. This allows you to focus on analyzing results and solving problems

AWS Batch plans, schedules, and executes batch computing workloads using Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, and AWS Fargate with an option to utilize spot instances

For getting started with AWS Batch navigate to this URL and follow the wizard steps:

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) offers the broadest and deepest compute platform, with over 750 instances and choice of the latest processor, storage, networking, operating system, and purchase model to help you best match the needs of your workload

We are the first major cloud provider that supports Intel, AMD, and Arm processors, the only cloud with on-demand EC2 Mac instances, and the only cloud with 400 Gbps Ethernet networking

We offer the best price performance for machine learning training, as well as the lowest cost per inference instances in the cloud

More SAP, high performance computing (HPC), ML, and Windows workloads run on AWS than any other cloud

For getting started with AWS EC2 create a new instance pressing the buttons highlighted in the following image
